## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https: https://github.com/Sakshid9/Travel_Website.git

##Map Integration
To enable the map feature, you need to get an API key from a map provider and replace the placeholder in the index.html file with your API key.


<!-- Replace 'YOUR_ATLIST_API_KEY' with your actual Atlist API key -->
<script src="https://api.atlistmaps.com/maps/sdk/atlist-sdk.js?key=YOUR_ATLIST_API_KEY"></script>
                                 OR
<!-- Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API key -->
<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&callback=initMap" async defer></script>
